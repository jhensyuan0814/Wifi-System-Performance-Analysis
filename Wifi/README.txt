In /src_code, there are 3 subdirectories:
-hybrid/
-coexistence/
-wifi/

 
In /src_code/hybrid/, there are codes for simulation in section 4.3 (Hybrid system).
execute
-hybrid.m: scenario
-hybrid_different_lambda.m: comparison of different value of lambda value
-hybrid_different_ms.m: comparison of different number of MS per cell

In /src_code/coexistence/, there are codes for simulation in section 4.2(Coexistence of WiFi and 4G LTE).
execute
-WiFi_LTE.m: scenario
-WiFi_LTE_with_diff_lambda.m: comparison of different value of lambda value
-WiFi_LTE_with_diff_ms.m: comparison of different number of MS per cell

In /src_code/wifi/, there are codes for simulation in section 4.1 (Standalone WiFi).
execute
-WiFi.m: scenario
-WiFi_different_lambda.m: comparison of different value of lambda value
-WiFi_different_ms.m: comparison of different number of MS per cell
-WiFi_different_CWmin.m: comparison of different value of CWmin
-WiFi_different_Ith.m: comparison of different interference threshold
